# Applied Informatics — Internet Computing

This repository contains the lecture materials for _Applied Informatics — Internet Computing_ held at _Karlsruhe Institute of Technology_ in the _Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB)_. The lecture is accompanied by the textbook [Internet Computing](https://internet-computing.net/).

**NOTE:** This repository is currently still a work in progress and will be completed in the coming weeks and months.

## Introduction

In this lecture, we provide insights into fundamental concepts and future technologies of distributed systems and internet computing. The course first introduces basic concepts of distributed systems, e.g., design of architectures for distributed systems, internet architectures, web services, and middleware. In the second part of the course, emerging technologies of internet computing will be examined in depth. These include, among others: cloud computing, edge and fog computing, Internet of Things, blockchain, artificial intelligence.

## Content

All lecture slides correspond to book chapters. We also provide exercises related to one or multiple lectures.
